<h1>Library App</h1>

<h2>Brief Introduction</h2>

This project is a library app that can take user's input and information on the title, author, number of pages, and whether the user has read it and enter it into the app.  The user will also be given the option to toggle the have read option.  The app functions as a way for users to keep track of the books they are reading and the ones they have completed.

<h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>

The skills that I will demonstrate from completing this project are OOP concepts such as creating objects and object constructors.  This project will help build a solid understanding of the OOP concepts applied in this app.
