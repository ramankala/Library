<h1>Library App</h1>

<h2>Brief Introduction</h2>

This project is a library app that can take user's input and information on the title, author, number of pages, and whether the user has read it and enter it into the app.  The user will also be given the option to toggle the have read option.  The app functions as a way for users to keep track of the books they are reading and the ones they have completed.

<h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>

The skills that I will demonstrate from completing this project are OOP concepts such as creating objects and object constructors.  This project will help build a solid understanding of the OOP concepts applied in this app.

<h2>Self- Reflection Post-Completion</h2>

Completing this project has taught me the skills I've expected to learn such as creating object constructors and objects to display on a webpage.  I learned how to store book objects into an array, and access the book objects as well as its properties and methods.  This project has ultimately re-established my foundational knowledge on objects in OOP, and further challenged my skills in manipulating FlexBox.

<h2>Live Demo</h2>

To add a new book to the library, click on the blue plus icon in the bottom right of the webpage.  Enter the title of the book, author, number of pages, and whether you have read it or not in the pop-up window that appears.  Once the information has been entered, the read status of the book itself can be toggled by click on the button.  Furthermore, each book can be removed from the library by clicking on the 'Remove' button.
